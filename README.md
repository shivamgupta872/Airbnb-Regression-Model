# Introduction
Building an Regression model to predict the Homestay prices of Residential Properties

## Project Overview
We had data of Airbnb there are some independant variable and a target variable with the combination of independent variable
we are trying to predict the price so baiscally we were trying to build the model which will in assist to predict target variable. 

## Dataset Description
We had around 74 thousand data of residential properties and 9 independant variable which will determine the price of that project. 
such as 
- room type
- bedroom
- bed
- cancellation policy
- instant bookable

## Methodology
 After importing the data with the help of pandas understand data & objective of this project.
 Delete duplicate values from the data & treat null values from the dataset.
 We treat null values in 3 ways to check the better accuracy.
  1. Treat Null values with Mean
  2. Treat Null values with Median
  3. Treat Null values with KNNImputer

## Data Distribution 
Use Heatmap for visualizing data patterns, correlations, and distributions.

# Conclusion 
By running model on different model the accuracy were around 50%, ask Business Analyst to share more independent variable to determine more accuracy.
